        <h1>Una Lady Like You</h1>
        <p>I know<br>You're looking for someone<br>To make you fall in love again<br>Who won't make you feel bad</p>
        <p>I know<br>There was another who<br>Didn't know how to appreciate<br>What you had to give</p>
        <p>I know, perhaps, he made you suffer (Made you suffer)<br>Made you cry, knew how to hurt you (Hurt you)<br>
        I know, perhaps, you already know about me<br>I'm following you, I won't lie to you</p>
        <p class="emotion1">I'm looking for a lady like you, I want her like this<br>I want you to fall in love like I am with you (Yeh, yeh, yeh)<br>
        To send flowers to your house and write in your name<br>A thousand love songs for you to think of me<br>Just like I think of you</p>
        <p class="emotion2">I want to talk to you, I want to hypnotize you<br>Bring you a star, bring you down from the sky<br>
        Sing to you softly and see your skin tingle<br>Take you slowly where it's just you and me</p>
        <p class="emotion1">And if you feel like it, I'll kiss your mouth<br>Dream of touching you, taking off your clothes<br>
        Don't confuse my intention with saying crazy things<br>I love you, but your body also tempts me</p>
        <p>To be able to please you, to know each of your dreams<br>
        To talk together until dawn, for you to be my woman<br>
        To be the only one to give you pleasure<br>Every day of my life to be able to have you (Have you, have you)</p>
        <p class="emotion2">I'm looking for a lady like you, I want her like this<br>
        I want you to fall in love like I am with you (Yeh, yeh, yeh)<br>
        To send flowers to your house and write in your name<br>
        A thousand love songs for you to think of me<br>Just like I think of you</p>
        <p class="emotion1">I'm looking for a lady like you, I want her like this<br>
        I want you to fall in love like I am with you (Yeh, yeh, yeh)<br>
        To send flowers to your house and write in your name<br>
        A thousand love songs for you to think of me<br>Just like I think of you</p>
        <p>I know you're looking for someone to fall in love with you again<br>
        Who won't make you feel bad (Bad)<br>
        I'm looking for a lady like you, I want her like this<br>
        I want you to fall in love like I am with you (Yeh, yeh, yeh)<br>
        To send flowers to your house and write in your name<br>
        A thousand love songs for you to think of me<br>Just like I think of you</p>
